### About me
I graduated as a metallurgist engineer. Now I've discovered that I don't want to do this, that I won't be able to get enough development in this industry. So I decided to try something new.

Once I tried to create my own website and I remember how much I liked doing it then. At that moment, I did not attach any importance to this and went the other way. But it's time to get back to what I really like. So my goal is to become the best front-end developer. 

I believe that I have strengths for this: 
* *Diligence, perseverance and attentiveness*
* *The ability to work in a team*
* *Self-development*
* *The desire to gain new knowledge*

I hope my efforts will help to master all the necessary skills and achieve the goal.
